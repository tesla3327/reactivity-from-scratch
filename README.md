# Reactivity from Scratch

Build a Vue-inspired reactivity system from scratch!

This repository contains the code examples and demonstrations for the free "Reactivity from Scratch" course, which explores the fundamental concepts of reactivity in modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Course Overview

In this course, we dive deep into the inner workings of Vue inspired reactivity systems. Through a series of hands-on examples, we build a simple reactivity system from the ground up, covering key concepts such as:

- Day 1: Build a basic reactivity system inspired by Vue 2, including `ref()` and dependency tracking
- Day 2: Implement `reactive()` using Vue 3's powerful proxy-based system for deep reactivity
- Day 3: Create `watchEffect()` with advanced features like scheduling, cleanup, and manual stopping
- Day 4: Develop computed refs for creating derived reactive values
- Day 5: Master ref manipulation with `isRef()`, `unref()`, and `toRefs()`
- Day 6: Implement readonly and shallow reactivity for fine-grained control
- Day 7: Build a reactive store, combining all concepts into a powerful state management solution

Each day's lesson builds upon the previous, gradually introducing more advanced concepts and techniques.

## Repository Structure and Demos

The repository is organized into daily lessons, each containing an `index.html` file and an `app.js` file. You can also check out the live demos for each day:

- `day-1`: Basic Reactivity Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/wvLRPJL)
- `day-2`: Deep Reactivity Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/GRbPOmP)
- `day-3`: watchEffect Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/yLdGPva)
- `day-4`: computed refs Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/WNqLXzv)
- `day-5`: Ref Manipulation Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/BagvmrX)
- `day-6`: Readonly and Shallow Reactivity - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/xxomPzY)
- `day-7`: Simple Reactive Store Demo - [Live Demo](https://codepen.io/michaelthiessen/pen/WNqLXKQ)

Additionally, there's a `global` folder containing shared styles.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to each day's folder
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the demo in action
4. Study the corresponding `app.js` file to understand the implementation

Alternatively, you can check out the live demos linked above to see the code in action without downloading the repository.
